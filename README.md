# OpenCV tutorials with C++

One site I've found to play with is the [official OpenCV site][ocv]. Quite a few
of those tutorials are for OpenCV 2.x, though I expect that to change in time. I
might even contribute to one or two of those. Who knows?

I've managed to build the first example called [DisplayImage][dim] on a VPS that
runs Ubuntu 14.04. The installation process there is much smoother than in 15.04
so I would advise you to work with that first.

## Completed tutorials
  * [Installation in Linux][ins] (OpenCV 2.0, but it works)
  * [Using OpenCV with gcc and cmake][ogc]
